I recommend that you use cl-yacc by Juliusz Chroboczek instead of this
package.  Among other things, his package properly supports operator
precedence and so on, and is a lot more polished -- I bet it's way
faster, too.

If that's the case, why am I releasing this code?  Well, I had already
written some things (like m68k-assembler) that depend on it.  Also,
the code is much shorter and I feel it might be more understandable to
someone unfamiliar with either package and looking to modify a parser
generator.  Also, the default mode of operation for this package is to
write the tables and parser to a stream, so you don't need to have
this package around at runtime.

Look at tests.lisp (or m68k-grammar.lisp in the m68k-assembler package)
for examples of the grammar form.
